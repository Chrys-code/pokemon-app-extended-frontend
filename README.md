# Requirements

Node
NPM

## Used:

React.js
CSS


## Arcitecture review:

AuthContext -> PokemonContext -> App -> Login page / Main page / Pokemon page.

Did not use Redux or similar state management tool as the scope of the project does not justify bringing in complex global state managers. It might also consumes more time to set up properly.

## Start

- npm i
- npm run start

## Tests

Had no time for test coverage the test found in App.test.tsx is just an example written by me.


## Features

Login
Register
Catch a pokemon


## Note

Please note that the application is not finished and requires more work.
Some APIs are still directed to localhost instead of using .env to get the correct URLs.
